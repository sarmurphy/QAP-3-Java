1. It took me roughly 8/9 hours throughout the week to complete this assingment.

2. I used Lecture recordings and YouTube videos to help me complete this assignment.

3. I did not need any help from my friends/peers.

4. I did not ask any questions of my instructors.

5. 6/10 for difficulty. I have a bit of a harder time figuring it out without a class diagram sometimes, but overall it wasn't too complicated or time consuming.
